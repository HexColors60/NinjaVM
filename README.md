# Ninja Virtual Machine

### What is NinjaVM?

The **Ninja Virtual Machine** was created as a university project.
This project was used to teach students the basics of _low-level_ programming
in the C language.
The purpose of this VM is to execute programs written in the Ninja-Language,
where Ninja is an acronym for _Ninja is not Java_.
Ninja is an object-oriented langauge. It can do all the basic things allmost any
other OO-Language can do such as arithmetic expressions, global and local variables, procedure calls, Records, Arrays, control-flow, and so on.
Something that is rather unique to Ninja is its ability to do arithmetic
with numbers of arbitrary length.

### Why would I use this?

**I don't know!** This is just a personal hobby project for me at this point.
The semester is over and I could just stop working on this, but I had so much fun during the semester that I decided to continue to work on this.
Clone the repository, tinker around with it and have some fun (if you like this sort of thing).

### How do I use it?

To use the VM is relatively straight forward.
To launch the VM, simply type:

```bash
    $ ./njvm myProgram.bin
```

Obviously you will need a program that has been compiled for the NinjaVM.
I will start to implement my own version of the Ninja tool chain starting
sometime in February. Until that is completed, I would advise you to
use the [assebler](https://homepages.thm.de/~hg53/ksp-ws1718/aufgabe8/nja) and [compiler](https://homepages.thm.de/~hg53/ksp-ws1718/aufgabe8/njc) from the university course.
