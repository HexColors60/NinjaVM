Debugger Documentation for NinjaVM Version 4

To activate the debugger, launch the VM with the command
line parameter --debug:

    $ ./njvm --debug programFile.bin

The debugger will load the program file and initialize the VM.
If an error occurs during this process, it will be displayed
to you and the VM will terminate. Once the initialization
process has finished, the debugger will prompt you with the
first instruction of the program and wait for a command.
The following commands are available and explained in detail
further below:

breakpoint, dump, edit, execute, gc, help, quit, reset, run, step, verbose

++++++++++ breakpoint ++++++++++

With this command you can set a breakpoint at a desired instruction.
This can be used in combination with the run command, because it is
the only way the programmer has to stop continuous program execution
once the run command has been given. 

++++++++++ dump ++++++++++

This command allows you to perform a "memory dump" of the VM.
It writes important information into a file of your choosing.
This information is comprised of the following:

- VM Version
- Exact Timestamp
- The most recently executed instruction
- A stack dump
- Current values from the static data area
- Current value of the return value register
- Dump of program memory

+++++++++ edit ++++++++++

- THIS FEATURE IS DEPRECATED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE-

Edit allows you to edit one of the following parts of the VM:

- The stack
- The static data area
- The return value register
- The program memory
- The program counter
- The stack pointer
- The frame pointer

++++++++++ execute ++++++++++

This command allows you to execute one arbitrary instruction that you
enter during runtime of the program. The execution of the instruction
can take effect on everything except for program memory 
and the program counter.

++++++++++ gc ++++++++++

This command initiates the Garbage Collector and displays
the GC-Statistics after completion.

++++++++++ inspect ++++++++++

With this command, you can look at the several parts of the VM.
You can inspect the following things: 

- The stack
- The static data area
- The return value register
- The program memory
- An Object-Reference

++++++++++ quit ++++++++++

Use this command to exit out of the debugger and the VM entirely.
It will cause the VM to skip the current instruction and exit the
execution loop afterwards. An exit message is displayed and the 
VM is terminated.

++++++++++ reset ++++++++++

Resets the VM into its initial state. The program counter, stack pointer
and stack-frame pointer get set to 0, global variables as well as the
return value register are reset to nil.

++++++++++ run ++++++++++

Starts continuous execution of the loaded program. The current
and all following instructions will be executed. Execution only
stops if either a breakpoint is hit, the VM encounters an error or
a executed HALT instruction terminates the VM.

++++++++++ skip ++++++++++

Skips the current instruction and advances the program counter by one.

++++++++++ step ++++++++++

Executes the currently displayed instruction and loads the next instruction
from program memory.

++++++++++ verbose ++++++++++

Toggles the output of the debugger once the run command has been issued.
If verbose is off, run will only output things from the vm.
If verbose is on, every instruction will be printed before execution as well.
